College has taught me to appreciate the now and find beauty in mistakes and situations outside of our control. This is especially true for someone who cannot afford the luxuries of choice.

If you have been reading this long, you know that my favorite people in this whole world are my little brothers. They were my first loves, my first fans, my first enemies, and my first playmates. While I had plans to spend the holidays with another friend, our plans changed, and I chose to visit my aunt in Chicago instead of flying home to California because of the last-minute travel cost. 

I do not say this to sound ungrateful for the opportunity to visit my family in Chicago; instead, I hope to provide an insight into the struggle of being a first-generation, low-income college student trying to figure out how to be present for my family while thousands of miles away. 

Maybe if I had considered travel costs, I would have been at UCLA instead of Duke. Who knows? In any case, I was still excited to meet my Tia Chuy in Chicago for the first time and explore the city with Liv and Rodrigo. Once I landed, my Tia greeted me with a confused look at first because, well, a teenage boy showed up at her doorstep with a suitcase. Once she recognized who I was, she welcomed me with a hug, a meal, and a bed to relax. 

Once settled, I finished some homework I had left to complete and went to the L to meet with Liv and Rodrigo for the day. While Rodrigo often was too sleep-deprived to join our plans, Liv and I explored Chinatown and filled each other in on everything going on in our lives over comically large pho bowls.

My favorite part of the trip was visiting the Randolph Street Holiday Market. I missed home, and the market reminded me of exploring estate sales with Ethan and my mom. I would walk up to vendors and ask the prices on ridiculous items, saying I needed a new mink coat for the winter or new pearls for my grandmother's birthday. I could see myself roaming these aisles with my family, pointing at items each other would love and gifting them.
