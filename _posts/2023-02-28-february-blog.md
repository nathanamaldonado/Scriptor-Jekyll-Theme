My classes are finally picking up, and while I am not too nervous about them, I am slowly anticipating the arrival of Spring break next month. That's still out there, though. In the meantime, I must fill my time with Arizona green tea to ease the pain.

## Spire Prom

I didn't go to my prom or any school dance. To be honest, I didn't want to. I know, I know, you only get one prom. While my high school did have one, COVID meant that we had multiple unorganized proms, and I wanted to avoid attempting to navigate that. What made it weirder was that "fun parents" often organized them and afters. Uh, no. I think I would rather drink glass shards.

SPIRE, though, had its own formal in downtown Durham called 'SPIRE Prom.' When I told Irma about it, she seemed excited, so I invited her, and we spent the rest of the night sporadically meeting people and laughing about these interactions later. 

Once I returned to campus, Michael texted me that he found my shoe in the library. Um, hello? He sent a selfie with my shoe, posed the way terrorists do with their hostages or hunters with lion's heads. I changed shoes at some point in the night, but we may never know how my shoe ended up in Perkins Link. 

## Parisian Pambazos

In other news, Paris also set up a time for a group to get together and make pambazos. I had never heard of a pambazo before and assumed they were like pan con pavo that my Tio Yeyo would make for us on our birthdays and special occasions. We offered to help, but Paris and Sergio handled everything. 

How they worked in the kitchen together reminded me of being home with my older family members, preparing food for us. While Ethan would cook more, I felt my mom could be more patient with me because I made less of a mess, so we often made tacos or gorditas together for my friends as a study snack. 

The last I heard, Ethan blew up our kitchen while trying to make popcorn. Apparently, he set the microwave on fire. Do what you will with that, but I know how to make popcorn. Y'all stay safe, though.
