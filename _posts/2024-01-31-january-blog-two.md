My brothers and I have been in the same classes since kindergarten and cycled through the same teachers our entire lives. Our first day back to school after winter break, though, now means aÂ two-hour drive to San Diego from Los Angeles, followed by a drop-off at Irvine and LAX on the drive back up.

My family started by driving to San Diego to drop Isaak off, where he told me about the classes he was taking this quarter: linear algebra and multivariable calculus. At this point in our relationship and academic careers, I could provide him with the praise he deserves for reaching the highest math anyone in our family has ever had. However, I took pride in knowing he would succeed in paving this trail without my guidance. 

Later, my parents dropped Ethan and me off at UC Irvine as I planned on spending the night with him before I left for LAX the following morning. Like Ethan, his roommates are queer Mexican teenagers from California. Their dynamic works, but it was hilarious, considering how similar their interests were. They are not clones, but their room gives twin energy. 

The following morning, I woke up at 4 AM to take the Metrolink and Green Line to LAX. I grew up on public transportation, but the homesick feeling of the Metro only amplified when I considered my destination was thousands of miles away. "Next stop is Aviation and LAX, as far as this train goes." 

Once I boarded my plane and landed in Miami for my layover, I was shocked to see a friend was on my same flight to Raleigh-Durham. Eventually, the telecom let us know that our flight was canceled. Instead, I would have to spend the next two days in Miami before the weather cleared. In a surprising turn of events, I spent these days trying Publix Deli Subs and playing with dogs in diapers. 

After returning to Durham, I made plans with Mahi and Noelia to get piercings. The piercer was offering unlimited facial piercings for $25. It would have been financially irresponsible not to take advantage of his generosity, so I got a double helix on my right, single on my left, and my double lobes pierced. When I told my brothers about this, they told me to explain this to our parents as an indigenous revival effort. 

They. Hurt. So. Bad.
