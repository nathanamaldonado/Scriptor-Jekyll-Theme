Last summer, my good friend, Mahi Patel, called me the Virginia Woolf of teenage boys. Now, I have graduated to a live-action Tim Burton twenty-something-year-old. While appreciative of this gift, turning twenty reminds me of everything I have left to do.

When my brothers and I were younger, we talked about visiting each other in college and staying in each other's dorms. I love California and my family, but I had to leave when I did. I had to become my own person and leave the loves of my life and best friends. 

This past spring break, however, I visited Isaak and Ethan in San Diego and Irvine. I could see how the other half lives in La Jolla and the suburban hell of Orange County. 

Fortunately, I could also celebrate my birthday in Los Angeles with my cousins and debrief family lore over birria and boba. I even shared a bed with Isaak, and my heart almost shattered when I realized this could be one of the last times we would do so. Still, being the first in our family meant that even if these "lasts" existed, I could still love and heal with my brothers. 

I could still edit Ethan's environmental science paper, pay for Isaak's hotpot dinner, remind them to wear sunscreen, and tell them how to apply for work-study. I could still be their older brother. 

Nevertheless, being the oldest and turning twenty reminds me of what one year from now will mean. As the son of immigrant parents, my twenty-first birthday denotes the day I can begin sponsoring my parents' citizenship. My parents and their stories are not mine, but what will it mean if I cannot help the people who have given me this life? What would it mean if they gave me everything but I could not? What would it mean if I could not help them continue their story?

When I was younger, my first-grade teacher wrote on my nametag, "Nathan 'Turn-Around' Maldonado." She later explained that because she had to say "Nathan, turn around!" so often, it naturally became my middle name. Nothing made my dad sweat more, though, than when I would tell him the night before that I had a school project due. 

Even in high school, I would need to use my finger to follow along with the words on a page. However, once I got to Duke, I could not ignore these little issues anymore. I finally received an ADHD diagnosis and have since started medication. Even though I have not been on the medication long, I can feel myself gaining that "imaginary apple" again. 

Before, if you asked me to imagine an apple, I couldn't. I would get distracted and would find it too difficult to focus. Genuinely, becoming more conscious of my family background and current environment allowed me to see that I have ADHD and can benefit from treatment. I do not have to live my life as a Mexican man, ignoring my problems until they get out of hand.

My friends also hosted a surprise birthday party for me, and I am so thankful for each of them and the part they have played in my college journey. Thank you for the mango mousse cake, the penguin pillow pet, the Fleetwood Mac record, and for being yourselves. 

I love you all, and I wish you love, peace, and happiness as we finish this semester!
