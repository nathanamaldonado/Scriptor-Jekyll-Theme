Julian chose to visit Los Angeles, so Irma and I had the privilege of showing him our home and saying repeatedly, "I know a spot." Irma told us about how her high school friends would go to the In-N-Out on Century Boulevard and watch the planes fly over while on our way back from driving past USC.

Of his stay, I will best remember the hike and time spent at Griffith Observatory, when Irma and I tried to shake him awake during the planetarium display because he started to snore. Still, it was all in good fun, and the family next to us also had a decent laugh. 

Later, Ethan drove down from Fresno to meet in Los Angeles so that we could prepare for our two-week trip to Guatemala. My cousin Karmen, already in Totonicap√°n, told me to put my hands in my pockets once I arrived because vendors would try to sell aggressively. As soon as I arrived, someone tripped, and as I reached over, they put a teddy bear and balloon in my hand and asked for fifty Quetzales (the Guatemalan currency). There is no good Latino left, I swear. 

Finally, my brother and I arrived in Guatemala City and were picked up by a smaller version of my father. Ethan and I looked at each other in shock because my Tio Herbert looked, sounded, and acted almost identically. When we told him this, he sounded horrified, as if we insulted the nearly fifteen years my dad had over him. My dad was not the oldest, but he is the oldest son, which shows. 

Again, when my Tio told me this, I recalled that my dad left Guatemala when his younger siblings still could not read or tie their own shoes. Instead, their relationship progressed only as far as the latest communication would let them, from landlines to FaceTime.

Once we arrived at my Abuelita's home, she welcomed Ethan and me with a restorative embrace. She ran her fingers through my hair and told me she could still see him in the both of us. My hair has the same cowlick he did thirty years ago.

Eventually, we left but with the privilege of knowing we would return and see the rest of our family we had not visited for ten years. My Abuelita let both Ethan and I go, reminding us to give my dad the love she could not.
