Having already visited my family for fall break and the homesickness slowly fading, I knew I wanted to spend the holidays with my friends. Fortunately, Liv was kind enough to invite Aaron and me to spend Thanksgiving with her family in the north Chicago suburbs.

Aaron and I arrived together, and I was taken aback when Liv picked us up from the airport and drove barefoot. I would be left in a random Midwest field if I said anything, though. I will get that driver's license one day, and you will all have to deal with it! 

Every day Aaron and I were in Chicago, Liv had planned every minute of our stay, even anticipating that we would sleep in every day (which we did). I saw everything: Willis Tower Skydeck, the Bean, and the Art Institute. Aaron and I trailed behind Liv like lost dogs, but the ability to travel with friends and explore their home is beautiful and an experience I hope to share with them one day. 

While my family celebrates Thanksgiving, we do not have any standard fixings like turkey or stuffing. Liv's family seemingly exceeded my expectations, and I was welcomed to a beautiful plate prepared by her mother. 

Later, Liv introduced Aaron and me to her friends from UIUC and Harvard; watching them catch up gave me unparalleled insight into how friendships evolve. It was as though no time had passed for them, a feeling I only get with my brothers. 

Amidst our travels on the L and downtown, we encountered a few classmates in a random shopping center on Michigan Avenue. Setting the exact time and location at which we would run into another group of Duke students seems impossible. Still, Duke is just that prevalent. There is no escape from the institution!
