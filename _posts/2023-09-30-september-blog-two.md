The second was my brothers' (Isaak and Ethan) birthday, and the more time I spend away from home or want to avoid it, the more I feel them becoming their own people. While proud of their accomplishments and maturity, I struggle to see them outside the little voices asking me to microwave their popcorn or get 'the good ice cream' from the top shelf.

These feelings were only later exacerbated after my family helped Isaak move into his dorm at UC San Diego. My cousins Juan and Miguel got into a crash and wrecked their car in a pole because they had been driving so late back to Los Angeles. They landed themselves in the hospital for a few days, where Juan FaceTimed our family from his bed, worried because his semester at Cal State LA would also soon start. 

Of course, I know I cannot help my family in this situation, but I cannot escape this feeling of watching life pass me. In all seriousness, Juan will heal and stay focused on school, and I wish Miguel the same recovery. 

My semester has also started, and even if I am not as social as I may have been during the summer or even my first year, I could take myself less seriously and make an effort to be outside, global, etc. I just have to get through Discrete Math, to be so honest.

On the brighter side of things, I have also been able to get closer with those in my computer science class, too, especially because we are the only ones who migrate from her two-hour-long office hours to the teaching assistant's two-hour-long office hours immediately after. 

By the way, no math is real. Also, I will have to start inflating my Spotify wrap before I get someone controversial as a top artist and can't post anymore.
