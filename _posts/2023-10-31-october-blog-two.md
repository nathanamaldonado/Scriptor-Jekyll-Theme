A few weeks ago, my parents visited me in North Carolina, and I even got to tour my home to my Abuelita and show her what exactly I have been up to this past year and a half. Sometimes, I see her and think about what it would have been like if I had stayed in California and commuted to USC from Boyle Heights. Could I have taken better care of my family, the very people who put me here?

For a night, I even stayed in my parents' Airbnb off of East Campus, and when I woke up, I was welcomed to the familiar smell of chilaquiles and slammed cupboards as my dad tried to find the mugs for his morning coffee. We talked about the same things as before, and no time had passed. I was in Los Angeles waiting for my parents to drop me off Downtown while I waited for my friends to come. I was offering to clean the dishes as before when my Abuelita grabbed my plates from my hand and scolded me, telling me to sit down instead. 

Figuring out my relationship with my parents was never going to be easy, but at this moment, I could invite them into my life again, excited to tell them about my life and hear about theirs. During their stay, I scheduled every minute of their time here, like when Ethan visited me during my freshman year.

Again, I told them I knew a spot, but they didn't get it: Gugulhupf, Nasher Cafe, and Chickenbee. My Abuelita cannot travel very far, so I took this as an opportunity to drive to Washington, D.C., and visit Saphal's family. Well, my dad drove. I promise, though, that I will get my license this summer! Saphal's family was also incredibly humble and loving; they only had the most beautiful things to say about their children and our family. 

During my parents' stay, though, I will remember the cultural exchange between my and Saphal's families best. They all spoke with rich accents, and it was impressive how they seemingly had two different conversations with each other but could still understand one another amidst the mistranslations and miscommunications.

They were lovely, and I was happy to see my home in North Carolina.
