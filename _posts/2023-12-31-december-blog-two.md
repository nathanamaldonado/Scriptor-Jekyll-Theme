Has anyone ever knit you something? My grandma taught my mom to knit, and she taught me. Knitting someone a scarf, blanket, or gloves is one of the most beautiful things humans can do for each other.

We decide that our love for you exceeds all effort and exertion. You are worth the thousands of stitches, each purl and knit stitch embodying my adoration of you. I love you a thousand times over, and I have often made these blankets for all the most important people: my abuelita, godmother, cousins, and brothers. 

I hope to knit you, whoever you are, something in this lifetime. You deserve to hold something and know that with each cast, a piece of myself is written into the seams of the blanket you toss over yourself. 

Beyond knitting with my mom, I prepared meals for our family with her this past winter break. Full transparency: I am the oldest son in a Latino household. I was never expected to know how to cook, but I swear I am trying. I could not graduate college without knowing how to fry an egg or boil water (yes, I know how to do bothâ€”not too much on me). 

Whenever I return to Fresno, my dad texts our family group chat, "Nathan, tell your mom you want [insert his favorite food] for tonight." He knows my mom will help prepare anything to welcome me home after being away for months, and yes, this is spoiled, Mexican man behavior. Will I indulge in his requests? I am only human, and, of course, I still help prepare these meals. 

Around these times, too, I will be reminded of a time in high school when I would prepare gorditas with my mom. She said I had mastered tortilla-making, which became my responsibility at every family dinner. Maybe she was throwing me a bone, but I was in there like swimwear.

With that said, I wanted to wish everyone reading happy holidays and let you know someone out there loves you, including me!
