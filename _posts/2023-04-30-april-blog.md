Ethan chose to visit North Carolina for his spring break to experience college for a week. I could finally show him places he had not yet seen and share my experiences and the parts of Duke I loved.

When he first arrived, my friends Dani, Cris, Ruby, and Ashley also chose to await his late/early arrival. Once his Uber finally got to Southgate, I took him to Pitchforks and ordered food while he tried talking to my friends. His 'flat earth' joke did not land, but Ashley broke the ice and made him schoolgirl giggle the entire way back. 

I planned his entire stay to the minute and ensured he would wake up on time. In high school, I could always count on either my mom or dad gasping incredibly loudly when they would walk into his room and see he was still asleep while the rest of us were in the car, ready to leave. 

On his first day here, I took him to a Dynamic Earth lecture, but I actually fell asleep this time. He found it interesting and even took notes, but there is no award for being a try-hard. Afterward, I took him to Franklin Street and the Commons, where he tried to swipe the expensive cutlery like a kleptomaniac. 

I even took him to the gardens for a picnic, and my scholarship director bought us tickets to see Rent. He fell in love with Alaina's character and thought she was hilarious, which I loved. Later, we played badminton with Aaron, his sister, Lauren, and Irma. During the entire bus ride home, Ethan told me Lauren was one of the most real and funny people he had ever met. It made me happy to see my brother get along with Aaron's sister and see how we can all contribute to each other's stories somehow.  

Lastly, we watched The Super Mario Bros. Movie with Dani, Ruby, Ashley, Mariana, and Mike, and while I was pretty confused the entire time, I loved Jack Black's Peaches the most. The last day he was here, though, was stormed over. He got an authentic North Carolina experience, and I am happy he enjoyed his time with me.

I have not been the best at calling my family recently, but seeing my brother helped me see how valuable this love is. Beyond that, he could finally put a face to all the names and stories I told him about. I am just now excited for my turn to visit him in college.
