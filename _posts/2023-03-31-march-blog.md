For some reason, people say the Spring semester feels more drawn out because of fewer breaks. I may have been mentally checked out for a while then. Just kidding, but not really. Finally, Spring break is around the corner, and I can relax for a second before I have another project due for computer science.

Aaron, Irma, Liv, Rodrigo, Mike, Mariana, and I decided to go to Washington, D.C., for Spring break to explore the East Coast cities while we're at Duke. While they tried making plans, I often slept in and woke up to an empty house. No complaints, though; my morning classes this semester killed my spirit and the academic weapon in me. 

For my birthday, my friends and I ate dinner downtown at a Korean BBQ restaurant. However, once I returned to Duke, I was surprised that Raphael had organized a surprise party for me. I told Cris and Ashley about how my mom would make platanos fritos con frijoles for breakfast, and they took me to Alpaca on Ninth Street to bring part of home to me. 

I know I am a location lurker. I know that. Still, for some reason, I was not checking today. Otherwise, I would have seen the twenty people in my room right before I was about to walk in. I love everyone who came to wish me a happy birthday, and I love every gift I received. 

However, two of the most beautiful gifts were from Sergio and Saphal. Sergio gifted me a children's book written in French and K'iche', knowing I would be starting the language track next semester: Je suis petite, moi? ¿In nitz' na? Saphal also found a picture of me and my brothers and customized a glass display with the song Amor Eterno written over it. Thank you again, everyone, for being part of my story.
