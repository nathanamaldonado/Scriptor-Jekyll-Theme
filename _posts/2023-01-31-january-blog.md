As much as I want to write about all the exciting things January brought, it was pretty uneventful. Instead, I was met with the typical burdens of a young adult just trying to figure everything out.

Before I left for North Carolina, Isaak drove Ethan and me to a Jack in the Box parking lot, and we did as all siblings do: fought over the last fry, chased stray cats behind alleys, and talked about our family and childhood. 

My dad hardly opened up about his childhood or his life, so my brothers and I speculated he was a Russian spy for the longest time, pretending to be a Latino California salesman. In reality, his upbringing was likely too complicated to discuss with us as children. It is difficult to think of my father as a boy, but I am sure he loved all the same things I did.

Our air conditioner did not work in Fresno, and in Los Angeles, our home predated all ventilation systems. So, all my brothers and I could do every summer to fend off the heat was sleep on the floor with our shirts off. Imagine my surprise when I found out it actually gets cold in Durham. 

Because of Accutane, my skin was too sensitive to go outside, so I was locked in when I was back in North Carolina. After a whole semester here, I finally got a chance to begin decorating my room. I ordered the same image prints I had on my wall back home and quickly put them up as soon as they were ready. 

This semester, I am telling myself I am a linguistics major. I have a personality beyond my navy blue sheets and empty bottles scattered across the floor. I finally asked my family to mail some of my stuff here, and my friends have also been spending more time here. 

Growing up, I never had a hangout house, so it was strange when my room became the pull-up room. With Liv's mattress pad and my rug, I suddenly found myself hosting sleepovers and movie nights. I tried putting them on American Horror Story, but I keep getting pushback. I will update you, though.
