Before I left for winter break, my friends and I celebrated Ashley's birthday at Chapel Hill. With my extra food points, I bought out all of Chester's Flamin' Hot Fries (yes, government name) and gifted them to her.

Immediately after this purchase, I decided to track my food points, and I found that Rodrigo had cleared my food points after asking to borrow my student ID because he had none of his own left. He opened his wallet to reveal five cards he had been alternating between. At this point, I began having to ask upperclassmen for food, too. Still, anything was better than paying with EBT. 

I decided to visit my parents in Fresno, and I found myself debriefing the chaos of freshman fall with my brothers for hours over random Netflix shows and spring rolls we prepared. They told me about their friend group drama and how senior year has been treating them. They have already submitted their college applications and now have to wait until March to hear back from UCs. 

After a week in the Central Valley, we drove to see the rest of our family in Los Angeles. Once there, I spent time with my cousins and even saw Irma at USC. After running into Dani at Korean BBQ, we went people-watching at the USC Village—my favorite past time. 

Korean BBQ was a little embarrassing, though, because the waitstaff kept having to come by our table to help us cook the meat. I am the firstborn son of a Mexican mother; I am deplorable for not having learned these life skills. I am sorry, but I will do better! 

I also stayed with my Tia Lish in Inglewood for a few days, and I was spoiled all over again. I have not tried the Guatemalan place in Durham yet, but I plan to go with Cris and Irma at some point. Still, nothing felt more comforting than eating chicken pepián and rice with chuchitos while my dad and Tia argued over who would clean the dishes. My dad would do his best to help, but my tia always spoiled him. 

When I was younger, I did not consider their age gap at all. They were just older than me. A couple of years ago, though, my dad told me that my Tia Lish was seven when he left for the United States, and I did not remember him. She only met him properly when she was a full adult. Of course, every sibling relationship is different, but this hurt me. I could not live without my brothers, so I was forced to consider all of what my father left when he fled Guatemala.
