This past Valentine's Day, I explored more of Chapel Hill and even visited the cat cafe on Franklin Street. The entire time, though, I felt like I was on another planet because of the Benadryll. Evolution should have corrected this, but a baby kitten named Tiger can take me out for some reason.

## K'iche' Fellowship

I recently applied for the Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship here, and I was selected to pursue K'iche' Maya in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, through Tulane. 

After hearing about my acceptance, I told my dad and sent him a detailed syllabus of the places I would see in Guatemala: Antigua, Xela, ruins, and volcanoes. Visiting our family this past summer with my brother was an incredible experience, and I am also extremely fortunate to stay close to Totonicapán, where my dad was raised. 

Amidst my father's congratulations, he said, "You will get to know more about Guatemala than many of us born there." Let me never do anything ever again. While I understand his sentiments and appreciate his celebration of my accomplishments, my dad unintentionally challenged my mindset. How can I contribute to a broader effort against indigenous erasure when I enter Guatemala as a scholar and, subsequently, tourist? How, then, can I construct a path for my travels in Guatemala while accounting for my family's history?

The guilt of being a first-generation college student is a burden I only wish upon students who complain about the LIFE study room. In Guatemala, my Abuelita showed me the sweater my dad left behind on her bedside when he fled Guatemala. She has kept it inside her pillowcase for the past thirty years, and I cannot do anything to change their reality. 

## Mirecourt 

In other unserious news, I decided to rush to Mirecourt, a selective living group on campus with Aaron. Bianca was my first friend at Duke and has primarily been a big sister to me throughout my time here, advising me when to stay away from biblical villains, encouraging me to apply for specific fellowships, and telling me to just chill out sometimes. 

When she presented Mirecourt as a space to meet more alternative people at Duke, I knew that, at the very least, I could also have fun with friends I already knew in the organization. While it is supposed to be a generally unserious social organization, people are still cut from the various rounds, and it is interesting to hear why some people think Mirecourt disliked them. That form of social policing is often inevitable when we give power to students no older than us to decide who can hang and who cannot. 

I can chill, though, but y'all stay safe. 

Oh! I also saw Mitski in concert at the Durham Performing Arts Center and had to call my mom afterward.
