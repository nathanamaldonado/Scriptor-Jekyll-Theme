At Clovis North, another minority student once told me I was the perfect model minority. I did not know how to interpret this information because she was right. I was brilliant but quiet; still, she did not have to say that.

Once I got to Duke, I received emails from SPIRE (STEM Pathways for Inclusion, Readiness, and Excellence) Fellows. Essentially, SPIRE is a selective fellowship for underrepresented minority students in STEM at Duke; Cardea is their pre-health counterpart. I considered applying when another student told me, "You are the perfect model minority. You should totally apply!" Oh, okay!

I understood the sentiment, but it was just as weird, if not worse. I applied and was accepted, but I still felt a little strange thinking that because I was 'unsuspecting,' I was just the type of Latino who deserved praise and accolades. 

My brothers' birthday was also a month ago, and no discomfort could mimic the pain of having to wish them a happy birthday over the phone. Around this time, I also received an update on the bedroom I often shared with my grandma in Los Angeles. There was a drive-by, and someone shot through my grandma's bed. Oh, okay!

With everything going on, I began feeling incredibly homesick and took fall break as an opportunity to visit my family. Once I stepped foot in California, my cousins and I explored Little Tokyo and the Arts District in Downtown Los Angeles. We laughed at the same jokes and gave each other updates on our romantic lives as if no time had passed. My cousin, Ariana, and I seemingly invite insanity into our lives without exception. 

It could be the examples we had as children or our grandfather. Still, I blame the genetic predisposition for acting like a mess. Who knows? 

Still, I watched the clock, knowing that in a few hours, I would have to make my way to LAX and say goodbye again. I had not been gone for very long, but my younger cousins began to forget my name. It hurt at first, but I know for a fact it's that iPad! 

Once I arrived at campus, it was time to start thinking about Halloween costumes with my friends. An upperclassman, Ariella, suggested we guys dress as Playboy bunnies while the girls dressed as Hugh Hefner. I don't think I have ever dressed up for Halloween. However, taking pictures with my friends and shamefully riding the Robertson Express was the healing moment I needed to distract from the homesickness.
