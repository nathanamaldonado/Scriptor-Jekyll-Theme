People at Duke often complain about Durham and North Carolina because they come from major cities like New York City or Miami. "There isn't anything to do!" As someone from Fresno, California, I understand.

Still, their sentiments often indicate that they are boring and cannot find the spontaneity to give their entitlement an objective. If you cannot find anything to do on a hot summer day, then the call might be coming from inside the house. 

On some Saturday, my friends and I decided to drop our plans for the day and go to Falls Lake. It was a split-second decision to skip the programming I had for my scholarship and join their plans. Once we arrived, I noticed I no longer had my swimming shorts. "You left your drawers on East?" shouted Rodrigo. 

Hope and Liv laughed hysterically, and once we concluded our beach day, we drove to Bojangles. Their speaker did not work, so a worker came to our table after our order was ready: "I know you are used to things being handed to you, but that is not how it works here." Oh!

Living fifteen minutes from USC, I understood his frustration with privileged Duke students. I couldn't be upset because I would love people-watching at the USC Village to determine the lives I expected these students to lead. 

When I told my high school government teacher I was between USC and UCLA, he told me to be careful because the area around USC was part of the ghetto. He then proceeded to warn us students about the barrios and how to stay safe in South LA. I did not know how to tell him my parents met on Crenshaw and Adams. If you were wondering, he went to UCLA, and yes, he was. 

He also told me I could not wear my guayabera at graduation or for my senior photo. Instead, I wore a cornflower blue dress shirt and a cerulean tie.Â I chose to assimilate despite knowing he did not want me there. Why would he, and why did I try? I was tired of losing the fight, but I realize now that exhaustion is the key to neglecting and disregarding identity.

On another note, Rodrigo, Irma, Michael, and I attended La Fiesta del Pueblo in Raleigh and were even able to see Grupo Mojado live! Maybe it's the California elitism in me, but I keep forgetting Latinos exist outside of California. Michael also tried to find oxtail from a Dominican food truck, but the line was too long. I trusted the place, though, even if it had no menu because a ten-year-old took our order. I know he runs that rinconcito on wheels like the Navy.
