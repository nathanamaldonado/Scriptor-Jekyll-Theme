When I left for the airport, my brothers were preparing for their first day of senior year. I pretended everything was the same and that my school was a little further away. Still, nothing could stop me from believing I made the wrong decision to leave California and my little brothers.

They are not so little anymore, though. I had to start reminding myself that I could not protect them from everything, and often, I could be the one hurting them. They needed to form their paths just as I did, and no matter how loud I played "Lo Que Construimos" by Natalia Lafourcade, I could not change this reality.

>No creas que no eres importante \ Al contrario, yo te amé con toda el alma”

My mom has always hated long car rides because of her nausea, so being on a plane across the country for the first time was a nightmare she could not wake up from. She squeezed my arm as we landed in Durham, and my dad and I peered out the window at the sea of green trees. 

Eventually, though, my parents left for Los Angeles. I knew I had to leave home, but this was my first time alone. 

I made an effort to become more social during orientation week, and I found Irma, whose dad went to the same high school as mine in Guatemala. I even met up with Michael from San Diego, whom I had been messaging on Instagram, and Bianca, who conducted my student scholarship interview.  

In high school, your friends are primarily limited to the people in your class, but I found myself befriending upperclassmen, too. For example, Ashley and Cris are co-parents of Mi Gente, the Latine cultural organization on campus. Paris and Sergio are also co-parents; Sergio even crocheted a flower for me, which I keep on my desk as my only room decoration. 

Lastly, I am trying to appreciate Duke and the opportunities allotted to me without idealizing the institution. For one, my orientation group (Project Identity & Culture) took a trip to Washington, D.C., during orientation week to visit the Smithsonian museums. Not only was flying to Duke my second time on a plane, but this was the only time I could have ever gone to our nation's capital for free.
